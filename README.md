# LoginScript
This login script pulls default Office and SnagIt templates from GitHub into employee's computers.

How to use it:

	1. Please use the link https://cdn.rawgit.com/SSWConsulting/LoginScript/260105f7/Script/LoginScript.rar to download the file;
	2. Close any Office applications open (or else the templates will not be copied);
	3. Extract both files to anywhere in your system;
	4. Right click on 'Launch.bat' | Run as Administrator;
	5. Click 'Ok' to the prompts, if any;
	6. If you are not logged in as a SSW user, input your username on the pop-up that appears;
	7. The script should copy everything and close itself when it's done.
	
	Note: Some red errors may appear. If you have any problems, ask Kaique at KaiqueBiancatti@ssw.com.au.
